      you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself (except for cookies and pixel
      tags, as provided in this privacy policy). When we do need your personal information to provide services that you
      request or when you choose to use our application, an AI tool built to help you achieve Spanish fluency (the "App"
      or the "Services"), or provide us with your personal information, for example when you decide to contact us for
      additional information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

      data is considered as Non-Personal Data when collected on an aggregate or statistical basis, or otherwise not
      combined with online identifiers.
    </p>

      Non-Personal Data may be used by us without limitation and for any purpose, including for commercial, research, or

      may be located outside the EU/EEA) which in some cases may have a lower level of protection than that within the
      EU/EEA. When transferring personal data to countries outside the EU/EEA, to jurisdictions that did not receive an
      adequacy decision or other safe harbor mechanism by the European Commission, we use standard contractual clauses

      IE stores the personal information as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the data has been
      collected. This means that IE deletes your personal information when such information is no longer necessary,
      unless we have a legitimate interest to retain such data for longer periods or are required to do so by any
      applicable law. Statistics which have been anonymized may be saved thereafter.

      requested services. You have the right to request a copy of your personal information from our record. You have
      the right to request a limitation of the use of your personal information (for example if you deem the information
      to be incorrect) or the termination of use of your personal information (for example as regards the use of the
      information to improve our services). Should you wish to submit a request for data deletion, rectification or
      access, please contact us at turinz.apphelp@gmail.com.
    </p>

    <h2>Data security</h2>
    <p>
      IE safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures, taking
      into consideration the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes
      of processing as well as the risk of processing your personal information. While we strive to protect your
      personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit to us, and so we urge you to
      take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.

      App. These third parties may automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us on
      our website or App using such third-party applications and tools, based on such third parties' privacy statements.
